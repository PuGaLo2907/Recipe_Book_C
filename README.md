# Recipe_Book_C

The project is made for educational purposes!

A desktop application has been made that performs the functionality of a recipe book for cooking

While creating the application, I studied the capabilities of C# for working with databases via ADO.NET

A database model has been created on the skl server and connected to the project in visual studio, written in C#. The interface part is written in the WPF framework (XAML)

To use it, you need to open it in Visual Studio, having previously downloaded the archive and unpacked it.
